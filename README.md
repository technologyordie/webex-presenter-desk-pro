Use the Webex Desk Pro feature of PC overlay in a Webex Meeting and get a full screen presentation.   

**Problem:** The Webex Desk Pro has a great feature that you use your PC input as a virtual background to use during a presentation.  However, the default view in Webex Meeting is Grid View which means you will show up in only one small portion of the screen.

**Solution:** This macro allows you to send the PC Overlay source as the content channel from the Desk Pro.  There fore you will get grid view.
